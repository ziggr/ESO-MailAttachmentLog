Do people email you lots of items for weekly guild auctions? Crafting materials? Need to keep track of them?

This add-on scans your mailbox, then saves all messages and attachments to a SavedVariables file. It can then convert that SavedVariables file to a CSV comma-separated-value file suitable for import into a spreadsheet.


[LIST=1]
[*]Go to Controls > Key Bindings > Mail Attachment Log. Assign a key binding.
[*]Hit the key binding you assigned earlier.
[*]Log out or Quit. ESO will then save data, writing SavedVariables/MailAttachmentLog.lua.
[*]From a terminal window, run
[FONT="Courier New"]% cd ~/Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/MailAttachmentLog
% lua MailAttachmentLog_to_csv.lua
[/FONT]This creates SavedVariables/MailAttachmentLog.csv
[*]Import MailAttachmentLog.csv into a spreadsheet.
[/LIST]

[FONT="Courier New"]MailAttachmentLog_to_csv.lua[/FONT] requires that you have downloaded and installed a standalone Lua interpreter, presumably from [URL="http://www.lua.org/"]lua.org[/URL].
